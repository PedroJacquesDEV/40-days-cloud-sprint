# 40 Days Cloud & DevSecOps Sprint 🚀

This repository documents my 40-day intensive journey to master Cloud Engineering and DevSecOps, focusing on the AWS ecosystem and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Day 1: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Foundations
Today I explored the core of AWS networking by building a custom VPC from scratch using Terraform.

### Technical Achievements:
- **Provider Configuration:** Set up the AWS provider for the `us-east-1` region.
- **VPC Design:** Defined a custom CIDR block (`10.0.0.0/16`) to understand network boundaries.
- **Resource Lifecycle:** Practiced the full cycle of `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy` to ensure clean environment management.
- **Environment:** All tasks performed on **Fedora 43 Workstation**.

### Tools Used:
- Terraform v1.14+
- AWS CLI
- Linux (Fedora)
